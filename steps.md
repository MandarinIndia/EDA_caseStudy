Step two : Analysis
    Categorical Analysis
        Univariate : Check for specific feature and for target variable feature for example gender do analysis of gender and then for churn customers do analysis of gender and compare and get insights
        Bivariate : Combine two variables and do the same
        Multivariate (if time permits)
